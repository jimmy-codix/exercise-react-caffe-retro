# Exercise: Caffe Retro â€“ React Edition

Now itâ€™s time to revisit the **Caffe Retro** exercise â€“ but this time, youâ€™ll build it using **React**.

ðŸ‘‰ If you havenâ€™t done the original version yet, or if you need a refresher, you can find the HTML/CSS version here:

## Goal

You are going to **recreate the same website** using **React**. The visual design and functionality should be the same, but now youâ€™re expected to apply a **React mindset**:

- **Think in components**: split the UI into meaningful, reusable parts (e.g. `Nav`, `Section`, `Header`, etc).
- **Use props** to pass data between components when needed.
- Use semantic HTML inside your React components.
- **Keep your code clean and organized** â€“ folder structure matters.
- **Reusability is key** â€“ avoid duplicating similar markup across the app.

## Instructions

The core **requirements remain the same** as in the original assignment. That means:

- Three full-screen sections: **Hot**, **Juice**, and **Cozy**.
- A fixed top **navigation bar** linking to each section.
- **Background images** that fully cover each section.
- **Semantic HTML**, **responsive design**, and **basic accessibility** must be respected.
- Use only assets provided in the `assets` folder â€“ no custom fonts or images.

But this time, itâ€™s your job to **interpret those instructions through React**.
